# Release 1.0

**What it does**:
- Picks up loot
  - Separate item names by commas
- Can bury bones!
**In the future, it may...**
- Pick up other's loot
- Be a generic looter that performs all tasks looting

**Things to know**:
- Is a refactor of AutoCombat's loot. Why? UNIX philosophy (and it fixes AutoCombat's loot)
- Turns off if not logged in or world hopping
- Turns off if your inventory is full, doesn't handle that situation yet
- May not loot all items! Looting is determined by name, so be aware that will sometimes fail
- Does not actually handle if your inventory is full when looting
